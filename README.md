# üìÑ AI Document Assistant

This is a web application built with Streamlit that allows you to interact with your PDF documents using the power of Large Language Models. Upload a PDF, provide a custom prompt or query, and get an intelligent response generated by Google's Gemini model through the LangChain framework.

The app is designed to be more than just a summarizer; it's a versatile tool for extracting insights, answering questions, and transforming information from your documents in any way you can imagine.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Upload PDFs**: Easily upload any PDF document directly from your computer.
* **Custom Prompts**: Interact with your document by providing any instruction or question.
* **Advanced Configuration (Sidebar)**:
    * **Chain Type**: Choose between `stuff` (for smaller docs) and `map_reduce` (for larger docs) to optimize performance.
    * **Chunk Size & Overlap**: Fine-tune how the document is broken down for processing with adjustable sliders.
* **Rate Limiting**: The `map_reduce` method includes a built-in delay to respect the Gemini API's rate limits, ensuring stability for large documents.

    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Your API Key

You will need a Google Gemini API key to run this application.

* Get your free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
* In the main project folder, create a new file named `API.env`.
* Open the file and add your API key in the following format:
    ```
